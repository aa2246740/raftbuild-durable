// `raft task show --target <ch> --number <N>`
// → one task's CURRENT title and description.
//
// Why this exists (task #323 item 6): the description was already reachable — `raft task list`
// renders it as `details:` — but only channel- or --mine-scoped. There was no way to read ONE
// task, so anyone verifying a single card had to eyeball a whole board. No server change is
// needed: agentApiTaskEnvelopeSchema already carries `description`.
//
// Labels are copied VERBATIM from the agent delivery surface (`Current title:` /
// `Current description:`) rather than invented here — @Tenny, task #323. Two renderings of the
// same field that disagree is the defect this card is about.
