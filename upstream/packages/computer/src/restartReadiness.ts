/**
 * Bounded runner-readiness readback for `raft-computer restart` (task #829).
 *
 * The live restart path hands the Computer service over via IPC and returns
 * without watching the runners: the replacement service must not depend on the
 * caller's shell. Field report #828 showed why that is not enough on its own:
 * the replacement service came up in ~100ms while all three runners spent ~250s
 * in the WebSocket retry envelope before reconnecting, so the user read
 * "restart requested" as "restart did nothing".
 *
 * This module keeps the handoff non-blocking but adds an observation window:
 * poll the same machine facts `start` gates on and report, per server, whether
 * the runner has connected *since the restart was requested*. A connection
 * marker written by the pre-restart runner never counts. On timeout the caller
 * prints a pending block plus where to look; it is not an error.
 *
 * Callers that run inside an agent process spawned by a runner must not wait:
 * restarting tears down their own runner. `callerIsRunnerHosted` detects that.
