/**
 * Released runtime form definitions, frozen.

 * Installed clients parse a runtime form by its schemaVersion. Once a version

 * recorded here, never with whatever the current code would generate, so a
 * server change cannot break a build that is already on someone's phone.
 * See README.md for the rules.
