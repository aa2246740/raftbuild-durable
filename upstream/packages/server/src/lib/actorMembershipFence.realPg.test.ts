// Real-PostgreSQL proof for the actor membership fence (task #91, matrix v0.2 R02/R04 atomicity for
// DB authority writes). PGlite serializes transactions on one connection, so "removal waits for an
// in-flight write" can only be observed against a real multi-connection Postgres. Blocking is proven
// from pg_stat_activity lock waits, not from timing. Runtime command dispatch ordering is out of scope
// here and tracked as task #93.
//
// Failure hygiene: every test releases its gates and settles its pending work in `finally`, and lock
// waits are bounded well below the per-test timeout, so a broken fence fails with a named assertion
// instead of leaving a transaction open and hanging teardown.
//
// CI: `pnpm --filter @botiverse/raft-server test:actor-membership-fence-real-pg`; locally, a Postgres
// container plus ACTOR_MEMBERSHIP_FENCE_REAL_PG_URL.
