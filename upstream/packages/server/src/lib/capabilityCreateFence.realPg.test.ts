 * Regression for task #611, kept permanently because the original defect was invisible to every other assertion here.
 * `freezeAgentInserts` holds a TABLE lock on `agents`, so a sibling real-PG file's agent insert queues behind THIS
 * file's freeze as well. Matching a waiter on statement text plus blocking pid alone therefore selects the sibling
 * session, and the pid handed to the next wait belongs to a transaction this test never started.
 *
 * Both directions are asserted: the unscoped form must select the sibling session (so removing the
 * `application_name` condition fails precisely, rather than silently passing), and the scoped form must select only a
 * session belonging to this file.
