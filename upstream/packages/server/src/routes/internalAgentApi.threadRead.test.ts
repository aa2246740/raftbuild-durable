/**
 * `raft message read` on a thread ref must name the entity that is actually
 * missing (task #145). Reporting "Channel not found" for a channel that
 * resolves fine cost one reader 8 retries and a "the read surface is flaky"
 * verdict on a deterministic empty.
 *
 * Five states, and the point of this file is that they are five, not one:
 *
 *   A  parent channel missing or invisible  -> shared neutral body
 *   B  short id anchors nothing here        -\  byte-identical: telling these
 *   D  short id belongs to another channel  -/  apart is an existence oracle
 *   C  anchor is here, but has no replies   -> the only case we may say so
 *   E  the thread exists                    -> ordinary success
 *   F  suffix is the thread's own id        -> resolves the same as E
 *
 * F is the `threadId=` field the header prints (first 8 chars of the thread
 * channel's UUID) pasted into the `#channel:<id>` slot. Before the resolver
 * learned it, that pasted id always answered B — "not found" for a thread that
 * plainly exists. It must resolve to the SAME thread, not merely any 200.
 *
 * ⚠️ B and D use REAL fixtures on purpose. If D's id simply did not exist, the
 * B/D equality would be true by construction and no change to the lookup could
 * ever redden it — an assertion whose result comes from its own shape rather
 * than from the code under test. D's id is a real message in another channel
 * the caller CAN see; the lookup is what refuses to find it here.
 * (@Tenny's acceptance, @Kai's catch, #proj-dx:4cd28c12.)
