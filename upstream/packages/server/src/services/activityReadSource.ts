/**
 * Test seam for the RisingWave-served Activity reads: the Activity item list
 * (getInboxItems), the Activity unread totals (getActivityUnreadTotalsBatch),
 * the followed-thread stats and the followed-threads rows (getFollowedThreads).
 *
 * RisingWave is a hard dependency: production reads these from RisingWave only,
 * and with no RisingWave configured (or a failed read) the request fails. There
 * is no Postgres fallback in the product.
 *
 * CI unit tests and e2e run on PGlite without RisingWave, so they explicitly
 * install a Postgres reference (src/test/risingWaveReadReference.ts) through
 * this seam. Like conversationUnreadSource.ts, this module is deliberately tiny
 * (type-only imports) so the test setup can install the reference without
 * loading channelService. Production never sets the override.
