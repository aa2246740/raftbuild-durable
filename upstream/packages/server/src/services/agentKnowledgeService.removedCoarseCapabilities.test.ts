// Five coarse capabilities were removed when authority became per-operation.

// ("production server code cannot reintroduce removed coarse capability
// literals"), and outside that guard they survive in packages/ only inside
// comments. The Manual teaches every one of them.
//
// The guard here is bound to the capability names and to the capability sets,
// not to any sentence: a rewording survives it, and a page that reintroduces a
// removed name goes red wherever it is written.

// Root is `manual/`, not `manual/agent-knowledge`: recipe cards are Manual
// pages too, and a guard that stops at one subtree is invisible exactly where
// the next page gets written (Cat, 2026-09-23 — she checked, recipes/ carries
// none of the five today, so this widening costs nothing and closes the hole).

//
// Clearing a page is not just deleting the identifier. Each one carries a
