 * at ANY connection count.
 *
 * The pacing is per-connection, not per-batch, because the batch variant
 * fails silently at real cardinality: with 25-per-batch and the ~29
 * connections a production task actually holds, "batch" 1 sends 25 closes at
 * t=0 and only the remaining 4 wait — the spread the fleet was promised
 * never happens (caught by Manjusaka on #8638).
 *
 * The budget is set by the caller: the ECS-drain trigger can afford the
 * configured 120s (it fires minutes before the force-close), while the
 * SIGTERM fallback must finish inside the shutdown deadline.
 *
 * Sockets that are already closing/closed are skipped; their normal ws
 * `close` handlers keep owning the bookkeeping either way.
