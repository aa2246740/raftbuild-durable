// channels.parent_channel_id phase 2: operator-run keyset backfill of the
// thread rows that existed before 0297. Live writes are already derived by the
// 0297 triggers; this only fills history.
//
// SCRIPT-ONLY: the sole non-test caller is scripts/parent-channel-id-backfill.ts,
// which builds its own single-connection pool. The server runtime never reaches
// this module.
//
// Each batch is one short autocommit UPDATE over at most `batchSize` thread rows
// in channels.id order. The value it writes is re-derived by the
// channels_parent_channel_id_update trigger anyway, so the column can only ever
// hold the parent message's current channel: a parent moved by a concurrent
// conversion is re-derived by whichever statement commits last, and the job is
// idempotent (`IS DISTINCT FROM`), so a re-run after any interruption only pays
// the scan. Row locks are FOR NO KEY UPDATE on thread rows, which readers' FOR
// KEY SHARE never waits on.
//
// Every updated row is also a CDC update to rw_channels, so batches are small
// and spaced; the operator runs it off-peak with the RW lag watch on.
