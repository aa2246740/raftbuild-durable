/**
 * Statement-count sweeps for the batched global_read_all claim
 * (Tenny/Ray spec, #proj-data thread 2026-09-24).
 *
 * What is pinned here, and what to do when a pin fires:
 * - X (sweep A pin): the fixed statement count of ONE batched
 *   global_read_all claim on the all-channel sweep. It is the sum of fixed
 *   per-claim statements (claim preamble + authority lock, candidate
 *   listing, local resolution, frontier, apply lock + upsert, terminal +
 *   authority updates). If you intentionally add a FIXED-per-claim
 *   statement, update the pin and explain in the PR. If the equality
 *   assertions fire with counts growing by N, that is an N+1 regression:
 *   fix the code, do not raise the pins.
 * - PIN_THREAD_DELTA (sweep B): the fixed extra cost of the
 *   thread-resolution statement (Y − X). Per-thread growth is a regression;
 *   an intentional fixed extra statement gets a documented pin change.
 * - Y <= 12 is a ceiling kept as documentation on top of the exact pins.
