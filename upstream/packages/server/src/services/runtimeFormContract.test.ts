/**
 * Released runtime form versions are frozen (task #1217, packages/runtime-form).
 *
 * The route answers a released schemaVersion from its frozen sample in
 * @botiverse/raft-runtime-form. These checks keep the rest of the server honest
 * about that: every version the server serves must have a sample, and while the
 * code builder is still the source of server-side validation for that version it
 * must produce exactly the sample, so the form clients render and the rules the
 * server enforces cannot drift apart.
 *
 * A red here has two legal fixes: revert an unintended drift, or bump the
 * schemaVersion and add a new sample. Rewriting an existing sample is not one.
