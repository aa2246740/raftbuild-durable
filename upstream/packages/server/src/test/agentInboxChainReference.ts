/**
 * TEST-ONLY reference for the agent inbox chain.
 *
 * Agent resume recovery (channelService.getAgentUnreadCounts and
 * messageService.getAgentResumeCatchupMessages) reads ONE source: the agent inbox
 * view of the unified RisingWave chain (`rw_agent_inbox_v5`, read through
 * channelService.readAgentInboxChainRows). CI has no RisingWave, so this derives
 * the same rows from Postgres with the SAME semantics as the view, and tests pass
 * them as the chain.
 *
 * This is a stand-in for the RW view, not a product path. KEEP IT IN SYNC with the
 * SQL it mirrors:
 *   - infra/risingwave/sql/068-chain-mention-v6-consumers.sql
 *                                                rw_agent_inbox_v5 (065's rw_agent_inbox_v4 on mention v6)
 *   - infra/risingwave/sql/067-mention-v6.sql    rw_inbox_mention_v6
 *   - infra/risingwave/sql/064-agent-inbox-v3.sql
 *                                                rw_agent_inbox_v3
 *   - infra/risingwave/sql/063-chain-v5.sql      rw_muted_subs_v1, rw_inbox_muted_prefix_v1
 *   - infra/risingwave/sql/063-unified-inbox-chain.sql
 *                                                rw_message_target_v3, rw_target_latest_v4,
 *                                                rw_target_eligible_v1, rw_receiver_cursors_v1,
 *                                                rw_subs_v2, rw_inbox_normal_v4
 *   - infra/risingwave/sql/061-inbox-derivation-chain.sql
 *                                                rw_thread_parent_v3
 * Each CTE below is named after the view it mirrors, restricted to one agent.
 *
 * Summary of the semantics (all the view's, none invented here):
 *   - subscriptions: channel_agents memberships (non-thread, not deleted/archived)
 *     and active agent thread follows. A muted membership (inbox_target_mute_states
 *     activity_muted) only admits messages with seq < mute_from_seq (NULL admits all).
 *   - unread: seq > cursor (COALESCE(last_read_seq8, last_read_seq)), excluding the
 *     agent's own sends, system messages whose causal actor is the agent, and the
 *     noise subtypes channel.self_unfollow_thread / task.deleted_summary. No join bound.
 *   - mention arm (v6): message_mentions for the agent with seq > cursor. A mention
 *     stored under a joint local projection id (the SENDER's projection) is first
 *     mapped to its canonical storage, then fanned out to every local target like
 *     messages. Visible through membership, parent membership, an active follow, or
 *     notified_at -- the notified outsider admission only for a target that is not
 *     a joint projection. A row that exists only through this arm has
 *     subscribed = false.
 *   - free-plan eligibility is per target: a free-plan target whose latest message
 *     is older than 30 days has no row at all.
 *   - joint projections: target_id is the local projection, storage_channel_id the
 *     canonical channel (active joint_channel_servers + joint_channels); messages and
 *     mentions are counted from storage.
 *   - thread parent columns: parent_message_id is COALESCE(rw_thread_parent_v3's,
 *     the thread's own channels.parent_message_id) -- the canonical parent for a
 *     joint local thread projection; parent_channel_* is the LOCAL parent as
 *     rw_thread_parent_v3 resolves it.
 *   - offered rows only (rw_agent_inbox_v5): the agent is joined (membership or
 *     active follow, joined_at not null) and the row offers unread: the admitted
 *     stream has unread (subscribed and unread_count > 0), OR mention_unread > 0 and
 *     the mention lies beyond the admitted stream (not subscribed, or
 *     max_mention_seq > latest_seq -- a mention after mute_from_seq pierces the
 *     mute, the rw_inbox_items_v9 rule for humans); the target is not deleted; a
 *     thread row only when its parent is not deleted and the agent belongs to it,
 *     or it is a public channel of the row's server. offered_unread = subscribed ?
 *     unread_count (+1 when a pierced mention exists) : mention_unread;
 *     activity_seq = GREATEST(latest_seq, max_mention_seq).
