/**
 * TEST-ONLY reference for the sidebar unread view.
 *
 * GET /channels/unread (bare and summary) and GET /servers/unread-summary read ONE
 * source: rw_conversation_unread_v2 (plus, for the summary, a request-time public
 * channel `hasNew` arm), through channelService's conversation unread reader. CI
 * has no RisingWave, so this derives the same rows from Postgres with the SAME
 * semantics as the view; src/test/setup/risingWaveReadReference.ts installs it for
 * every server test (and the e2e server) through the seam in
 * services/conversationUnreadSource.ts.
 *
 * This is a stand-in for the RW view, not a product path. KEEP IT IN SYNC with the
 * SQL it mirrors:
 *   - infra/risingwave/sql/068-chain-mention-v6-consumers.sql
 *                                                rw_conversation_unread_v2
 *   - infra/risingwave/sql/067-mention-v6.sql    rw_inbox_mention_v6
 *   - infra/risingwave/sql/066-conversation-unread-v1.sql
 *                                                rw_inbox_muted_full_v1
 *   - infra/risingwave/sql/063-chain-v5.sql      rw_muted_subs_v1

 *                                                rw_target_eligible_v1, rw_receiver_cursors_v1,
 *                                                rw_subs_v2, rw_inbox_normal_v4
 *   - infra/risingwave/sql/061-inbox-derivation-chain.sql
 *                                                rw_thread_parent_v3, rw_message_preview_v1
 *   - channelService readConversationUnreadSummaryRows / readSidebarUnreadTotals
 *                                                (the reader's WHERE and the public arm)
 * Each CTE below is named after the view it mirrors, restricted to one user.
 *
 * Summary of the semantics (all the view's, none invented here):
 *   - subscriptions: channel_humans memberships (non-thread, not deleted/archived),
 *     split into unmuted (rw_subs_v2) and muted (rw_muted_subs_v1) -- the muted arm
 *     keeps the FULL count (no mute_from_seq cut) -- and active user thread follows.
 *   - unread: seq > cursor (user_channel_read_cursors.last_read_seq), excluding the
 *     user's own sends, system messages whose causal actor is the user (a NULL
 *     causal actor never excludes), and the noise subtypes
 *     channel.self_unfollow_thread / task.deleted_summary.
 *   - mention arm (v6): message_mentions for the user (any admission flag). A
 *     mention stored under a joint local projection id (the SENDER's projection) is
 *     first mapped to its canonical storage, then fanned out to every local target.
 *     Visible through membership, parent membership, an active follow, or
 *     notified_at -- the notified outsider admission only for a non-projected target;
 *     mention_unread counts seq > cursor, total_mentions all of them. A row that
 *     exists only through this arm has subscribed = false.
 *   - free-plan eligibility is per target: a free-plan target whose latest message
 *     is older than 30 days has no row at all (both arms).
 *   - joint projections: target_id is the LOCAL projection; messages and mentions
 *     are counted from the canonical storage channel.
 *   - a thread row exists only while followed, not done, under a live (not deleted,
 *     not archived) parent the user can see: public, or a member of it.
 *   - public arm (reader, not view): the server's live public ('channel') channels
 *     the user has not joined, eligible, whose latest seq is past the user's cursor.

 * aggregates (rw_target_latest_v4, rw_target_eligible_v1, the unread counts) are
 * evaluated only for those targets, through (channel_id, seq) / (channel_id,
 * created_at) index probes. Three shortcuts, each unable to change the output:
 *   - a thread row survives the final filter only while subscribed and not done, so
 *     done follows are dropped up front (a mention-only thread row never survives);
 *   - u.server_id is always the target channel's server_id, so the server filter is
 *     applied to each arm before aggregation instead of after;
 *   - latest_at only matters for free-plan eligibility, so it is read only there.
