/**
 * The scrubbed failure message, returned only when the text carries no inlined value.
 *
 * WHY THIS FIELD EXISTS (stated where it is consumed, and unchanged): `error_class`
 * is one coarse token and `sqlstate` is absent for every socket/pool-layer failure,
 * so without the message a failed query cannot say why. Measured over 12h of
 * production db spans, 8 of the 11 records that carry a message are exactly that
 * case -- a statement timeout, which holds no user data.
 *
 * WHY THE TEXT IS SOMETIMES WITHHELD: the comment above the secondary-field split
 * assumed the primary message holds the cause and no row data. That assumption is
 * false for a whole class of Postgres errors, where the value is INLINED in the
 * primary text:
 *
 *     invalid input syntax for type uuid: "6f38f98d-..."
 *
 * so the message is dropped whenever it contains a quoted literal, and the caller
 * falls back to the canned excerpt plus the SQLSTATE (22P02 already names that
 * cause). Errors whose wording carries no value -- statement timeouts, unique
 * violations naming a constraint -- keep their message.
 *
 * ⚠️ SCOPE -- READ THIS BEFORE TREATING THE RULE AS A GUARANTEE.
 *
 * The direction of this rule is FAIL-OPEN: it withholds the message only when
 * it RECOGNISES an inlined value. Anything it does not recognise is carried --
 * an unquoted identifier, a value whose wording it has not seen, a form
 * introduced by a future Postgres version. An attachment UUID was observed
 * reaching this field in production, and that is an instance of the default
 * behaviour, not an exception to it.
 *
 * So the coverage cannot be enumerated, and a list of "what it does not catch"
 * would read as if it were complete. To use this as a guarantee, invert the
 * default first: withhold unless the message is positively known to be
 * value-free.
