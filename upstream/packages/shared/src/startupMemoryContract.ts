 * Everything else derives from the single root parameter below:
 *
 *   injection cap (bytes) = budget tokens x approx bytes/token
 *   recommended MEMORY.md size = the injection cap ("fits fully into every
 *     fresh session" — past it the file's tail stops reaching wakes)
 *   CLI-guide target copy = the same cap, interpolated (only for agents on
 *     servers with the `constructed_wake_context` flag on)
 *
 * The Cleaner idle-hint threshold is NOT derived from this cap yet: its
 * default is a global config shared by every server, so it keeps 64 KiB until
 * the startup memory block is on everywhere.
 *
 * Change the root here and every surface moves together; nothing else in the
 * repo may restate these numbers.
