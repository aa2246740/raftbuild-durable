 *
 * @Leiysky's rule for membership (#422 item 3). The test is NOT whether a key

 *
 *   A. "this value is on this record", and it is not => FALSE. Remove it, or
 *      replace it with a claim this side can stand behind.
 *   B. "the source had this value" => that is true even when the value never
 *      reaches disk, so the flag MAY STAY, on two conditions: (i) the comment
 *      says it is a source-side fact, not a disk-side one; and (ii) no
 *      similarly-named value travels with it, or a reader goes looking for
 *      something that is not there.
 *   C. the value is on the same record => merely REDUNDANT. May stay, but say
 *      so, or a later reader takes it for an independent piece of evidence.
 *
 * Class A, and therefore in this set:
 *
 *   `session_id_present` — superseded by `session_id_hash_present`, which this
 *   sink writes from what it actually did.
 *
 *   `producer_fact_id_present` — the value is scrubbed by the #460 ruling. The
 *   fact id is also generated on every event, so the flag is constant and
 *   carries no information even before the scrub.
 *
 * Class B, and therefore deliberately NOT in this set:
 *
 *   `runtime_session_id_present` (`daemon/src/drivers/piToolExecutionObservability.ts`)
 *   says a pi tool had a session when it got stuck. That is a source-side fact
 *   and, unlike `session_id`, it has NO OTHER CARRIER: `runtime_session_id` is
 *   neither written nor hashed. It is also pinned by the `stuck_tool_v0`
 *   identity contract (`core.ts`). The reason it is treated differently from
 *   `session_id_present` is not the name — it is that `session_id` has a hash
 *   form able to carry the fact and `runtime_session_id` does not.
 *
 *   If `runtime_session_id` is ever hashed, this flag moves from B to A and
 *   must be replaced by that value. It would need ITS OWN key,
 *   `runtime_session_id_hash`. Do NOT add it to `SESSION_ID_KEYS`: every key in
 *   that set is written out as the SAME `session_id_hash`, so a second one
 *   overwrites the real session's hash and yields a value that joins
 *   successfully to the wrong session — worse than a missing one, because the
 *   reader gets an answer (@Stone).
 *
 * Class C is why the server's own `producer_fact_id_present`
 * (`agentOrchestrator.ts`) is absent here: that span carries the raw
 * `producer_fact_id` beside the flag, and it is a surface this sink cannot
 * reach anyway. `client_seq_present` is the in-test control for the boundary.
 *
 * Removals here do NOT go through `onDrop`: this is a planned replacement, not
 * an unexpected drop, so it would inflate the counter that exists to find the

 * Families sharing the `daemon-trace-` prefix but NOT the rotation lifecycle.
 *
 * They are written by other producers entirely — `packages/cli/src/transportTrace.ts`
 * (one file per CLI process that hits a transport error) and the diagnostics push
 * path (one file per correlation id) — and neither producer prunes. Before this
 * split, `pruneOldFiles` matched them with the shared prefix and ordered every
 * candidate lexicographically, which is why they mattered:
 *
 *   'daemon-trace-2…' < 'daemon-trace-cli-transport-…' < 'daemon-trace-diag-…'
 *
 * Rotating names begin with a digit, so they sorted FIRST and were therefore
 * always the deletion victims, while the non-rotating families were reached only
 * once every rotating file was already gone. With N non-rotating files present
 * the surviving rotating count was `max(0, maxFiles - N)`, so N >= maxFiles left
 * zero, and N >= maxFiles - 1 left only the in-progress file. The uploader skips
 * the file currently being written, so such a registration produced no
 * upload-eligible trace at all — permanently, since nothing reduces N.
 *
 * Budgets are therefore per family. A family that is not the rotating one can no
 * longer consume rotating slots, and every family still has an owner that
 * reclaims it. Do NOT collapse these back into one budget, and do NOT fix a
 * future recurrence by excluding a family from the glob: this prune is that
 * family's only deletion path, so excluding it trades starvation for unbounded
 * growth.
 *
 * KNOWN BOUNDARY: these budgets bound the file COUNT of a non-rotating family,
 * never its BYTES. Only the rotating family has a byte ceiling
 * (`maxFileBytes`); the others have none at any size.
 *
 * Today that is tolerable on measured magnitude alone — @Kabi and @Manjusaka
 * read two hosts on 2026-09-17 and found the largest such file at 582 B, with 22
 * files totalling 12.7 KB. Take that as a reading of current USAGE and nothing
 * more (@Manjusaka's own framing, correcting an earlier draft of this comment
 * that cited them for a structural guarantee they had not claimed).
 *
 * It is NOT a design guarantee, and specifically these producers do not "write
 * once": `packages/cli/src/transportTrace.ts` memoises one path per process and
 * appends on every normalized transport error, so one long-lived or
 * error-looping process grows a single file without bound. The files are small
 * because CLI processes are short and usually fail once — a usage pattern, not
 * an invariant. A byte budget per family is the real fix whenever that pattern
 * stops holding.
 *
 * Recorded here rather than only in review because the change that would break
 * it gets made in the producer, where this constraint is invisible.
