/**
 * The application's root provider composition — the ONE place that defines
 * which contexts every screen under <App/> may rely on, and in what order.
 *
 * Every host that mounts the web app (the web entry, the desktop shell, test
 * harnesses) must render through this component instead of re-listing the
 * providers by hand. Desktop 0.1.29 (2026-09-24) shipped crashing after login
 * because its entry had hand-copied this tree and missed a provider a later web
 * change made mandatory; nothing in either CI noticed. Keeping the composition
 * here means a new required context reaches every host on its next build.
 *
 * Contract for adding a provider: add it here, and add a probe for the hook it
 * backs to tests/appProviders.behavior.test.tsx so hosts are proven complete.
 *
 * Hosts customise only through the props below — never by wrapping a subset:
 * - `router`: the react-router router (web + desktop: BrowserRouter; tests:
 *   MemoryRouter).
 * - `insideRouter`: elements that must live under the router but above the
 *   locale/intl layer (web: the service-worker navigation bridge).
