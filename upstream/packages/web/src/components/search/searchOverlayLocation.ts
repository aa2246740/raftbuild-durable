 *
 * Why a URL param and not history state: the results page has several independent
 * URL writers that `navigate(..., { replace: true })` WITHOUT state — MainLayout's
 * searchContentStore → `?open=`/`?msg=` sync (i.e. clicking a hit to open the col-3
 * preview), the right-panel `?thread=` sync, the page's own param updates. State is
 * owned by whoever navigated last, so a state marker would be dropped by the very
 * first preview click and the overlay would re-wrap the page (review finding on
 * PR #8012). Every one of those writers rebuilds from the current URL
 * (`new URLSearchParams(window.location.search | prev)`), so a param survives all
 * of them by construction. Opt-in per hop: ⌘K / rail / deep links never add it, so
 * they are overlays again. Web ignores it (the resolver is already null there);
 * it is not a persisted search-state key and is never forwarded to the API.
