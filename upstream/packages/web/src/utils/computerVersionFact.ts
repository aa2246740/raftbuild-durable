/**
 * What the web can say about a Computer's version, before any question of
 * whether web upgrade is switched on (computer-upgrade-copy-proposal §2.1).
 *
 * "Is it up to date" is the web's own comparison of the Computer's version
 * with the latest published Computer version. It does not depend on the
 * server's broadcast policy: with web upgrade switched off the policy stops at
 * its gate and never compares versions, which used to make an up-to-date
 * Computer read as "not eligible for an upgrade".
 *
 * - `unknown`: the Computer has not reported a version yet.
 * - `cannotCheck`: no answer right now, because no published version is known,
 *   a version is not SemVer, or the server could not look up a release for
 *   this machine (release service error, unknown platform, no artifact).
 * - `current`: on (or past) the latest published version.
 * - `outdated`: a newer version exists; `availableVersion` is the one to show.
