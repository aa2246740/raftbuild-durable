//   desktop-native  Raft Desktop: the renderer's Notification API maps straight to
//                   OS notifications (DesktopNativeBridge already fires them for
//                   live messages while the window is unfocused). Web Push does not
//                   apply: the app:// origin cannot host a service worker and
//                   Electron has no push service.
//   web-push        A browser with service workers + PushManager + Notification on
//                   a secure origin.
//   unsupported     Anything else, with the concrete reason so the UI can say why.
