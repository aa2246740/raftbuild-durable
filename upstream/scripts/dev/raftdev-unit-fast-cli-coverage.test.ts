 * trace-client was in NO workflow at all: `unit-fast` enumerates its packages
 * explicitly and did not list it, and `trace-client` appeared nowhere else under
 * `.github/`. Its suite had fourteen tests and nothing executed any of them,
 * which is the most likely reason a pure file-selection bug in the trace sink's
 * prune survived — the local trace sink decides whether a machine retains any
 * uploadable trace at all, and registrations were measured blind for 22-54 days.
 *
 * #308 added the package to the loop. This pins it there: adding an entry and
 * pinning the entry are separate guarantees, and only the second survives the
 * next person editing this list.

/**
 * CONVENTION (adopted 2026-09-21; ruled by 庄天翼 in the #8081 adjudication --
 * he wrote the ruling and executed the merge, squash eb548397e; the
 * #proj-raft-cli channel description records his design-DRI appointment.
 * Thread #proj-raft-cli:d009d816 holds the update history: since their
 * introduction in 40f1a051b (inclusive; 2026-08-31T18:56Z) the pins were
 * raised repeatedly inside ordinary commits, with two dips. Enumerating that
 * history is rename-sensitive -- this test file has had three names, recorded
 * sweeps disagree with each other, so no count is asserted here; the
 * numbers and methods live in the thread):
 * `fileCount` and `total` are MIRRORS of test-execution-manifest.json, not
 * independently-signed quotas. When a change legitimately adds or removes CLI
 * tests, regenerate the manifest (`pnpm --filter @botiverse/raft
 * test:update-manifest`; the script lives in packages/cli, not the repo root)
 * and update these two pins in the same change, stating the per-file delta in
 * the change description. The pins exist so that a manifest drift is a
 * conscious, enumerated act -- never to freeze the count.
 *
 * Known boundary (trigger surface and job gate are two different layers): the
 * Test workflow triggers on every pull_request, pushes to staging, manual
 * dispatch, and schedule; the unit-fast job gate then skips pull_request runs
 * unless the head is a same-repo `stamp-mq/` branch. Net effect: an ordinary
 * PR never runs this check, so a stale pin surfaces after merge on staging
 * (the scheduled run is a second post-merge chance: it runs on the default
 * branch to catch drift on days with no merges) -- or earlier, via a manual
 * dispatch against any ref (the PR head being the useful case) or a
 * same-repo `stamp-mq/` PR.
 * Deriving the pin from the manifest, or running this check on PRs that touch
 * CLI tests, would remove that trap -- tracked separately; this comment only
 * records the update convention.
